## Hints ##

Below are some hints that may help with this homework assignment:

- Focus on just getting the sorting order working first, then worry about using the right kind of class or lamba expression second.

- There are several ways you can implement each comparator. The Javadocs refer to some useful methods, but you do not HAVE to use them.

You are not required to use these hints in your solution. There may be multiple approaches to solving this homework.
