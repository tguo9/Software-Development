it is an old observ that the best writer sometim disregard the 
rule of rhetor when they do so howev the reader will usual 
find in the sentenc some compens merit attain at the cost of 
the violat unless he is certain of do as well he will probabl

secret of style to the studi of the master of literatur 




ii elementari rule of usag 


form the possess singular of noun by ad s 

follow this rule whatev the final conson thus write 

charless friend 

burnss poem 

the witch malic 

this is the usag of the unit state govern print offic and of 
the oxford univers press 

except are the possess of ancient proper name in es and 
is the possess jesus and such form as for conscienc 
sake for righteous sake but such form as achill heel 
mose law isi templ are common replac by 

the heel of achill 

the law of mose 

the templ of isi 

the pronomin possess her it their your and 
oneself have no apostroph 


in a seri of three or more term with a singl conjunct use a 
comma after each term except the last 

thus write 

red white and blue 

gold silver or copper 

he open the letter read it and made a note of it content 

this is also the usag of the govern print offic and of the 
oxford univers press 

in the name of busi firm the last comma is omit as 

brown shipley co 


enclos parenthet express between comma 

the best way to see a countri unless you are press for time is to 
travel on foot 

this rule is difficult to appli it is frequent hard to decid whether 
a singl word such as howev or a brief phrase is or is not 
parenthet if the interrupt to the flow of the sentenc is but 
slight the writer may safe omit the comma but whether the 
interrupt be slight or consider he must never insert one comma 
and omit the other such punctuat as 

marjori husband colonel nelson paid us a visit yesterday 

or 

my brother you will be pleas to hear is now in perfect health 

is indefens 

if a parenthet express is preced by a conjunct place the 
first comma befor the conjunct not after it 

he saw us come and unawar that we had learn of his treacheri 
greet us with a smile 

alway to be regard as parenthet and to be enclos between comma 
or at the end of the sentenc between comma and period are the 
follow 

the year when form part of a date and the day of the month 
when follow the day of the week 

februari to juli 

april 

monday novemb 

the abbrevi etc and jr 

nonrestrict relat claus that is those which do not serv 
to identifi or defin the anteced noun and similar claus 
introduc by conjunct indic time or place 

the audienc which had at first been indiffer becam more and 
more interest 

in this sentenc the claus introduc by which doe not serv to tell 
which of sever possibl audienc is meant what audienc is in 
question is suppos to be alreadi known the claus add 
parenthet a statement supplement that in the main claus the 
sentenc is virtual a combin of two statement which might have 
been made independ 

the audienc had at first been indiffer it becam more and more 
interest 

compar the restrict relat claus not set off by comma in the 
sentenc 

the candid who best meet these requir will obtain the place 

here the claus introduc by who doe serv to tell which of sever 
possibl candid is meant the sentenc cannot be split up into two 
independ statement 

the differ in punctuat in the two sentenc follow is base on 
the same principl 

nether stowey where coleridg wrote the rime of the ancient 
marin is a few mile from bridgewat 

the day will come when you will admit your mistak 

nether stowey is complet identifi by it name the statement about 
coleridg is therefor supplementari and parenthet the day spoken 
of is identifi onli by the depend claus which is therefor 
restrict 

similar in principl to the enclos of parenthet express between 
comma is the set off by comma of phrase or depend claus 
preced or follow the main claus of a sentenc 

part by hard fight part by diplomat skill they enlarg 
their dominion to the east and rose to royal rank with the 
possess of sicili exchang afterward for sardinia 

other illustr may be found in sentenc quot under rule 
and 

the writer should be care not to set off independ claus by 
comma see under rule 


place a comma befor a conjunct introduc a coordin claus 

the earli record of the citi have disappear and the stori of it 
first year can no longer be reconstruct 

the situat is peril but there is still one chanc of escap 

sentenc of this type isol from their context may seem to be in 
need of rewrit as they make complet sens when the comma is 
reach the second claus has the appear of an afterthought 
further and is the least specif of connect use between 
independ claus it indic onli that a relat exist between 
them without defin that relat in the exampl abov the relat 
is that of caus and result the two sentenc might be rewritten 

as the earli record of the citi have disappear the stori of it 
first year can no longer be reconstruct 

although the situat is peril there is still one chanc of 
escap 

or the subordin claus might be replac by phrase 

owe to the disappear of the earli record of the citi the stori 
of it first year can no longer be reconstruct 

in this peril situat there is still one chanc of escap 

but a writer may err by make his sentenc too uniform compact and 
period and an occasion loos sentenc prevent the style from 
becom too formal and give the reader a certain relief consequ 
loos sentenc of the type first quot are common in easi unstudi 
write but a writer should be care not to construct too mani of his 
sentenc after this pattern see rule 

twopart sentenc of which the second member is introduc by as in 
the sens of becaus for or nor and while in the sens 
of and at the same time likewis requir a comma befor the 
conjunct 

if the second member is introduc by an adverb a semicolon not a 
comma is requir see rule the connect so and yet may be 
use either as adverb or as conjunct accord as the second 
claus is felt to be coordin or subordin consequ either 
mark of punctuat may be justifi but these use of so equival 
to accord or to so that are somewhat colloqui and should as 
a rule be avoid in write a simpl correct usual servic 
is to omit the word so and begin the first claus with as or 
sinc 

i had never been in the place befor so i had difficulti in find 
my way about 

as i had never been in the place befor i had difficulti in find 
my way about 

if a depend claus or an introductori phrase requir to be set off 
by a comma preced the second independ claus no comma is need 
after the conjunct 

the situat is peril but if we are prepar to act prompt 
there is still one chanc of escap 

when the subject is the same for both claus and is express onli 
onc a comma is requir if the connect is but if the connect 
is and the comma should be omit if the relat between the two 
statement is close or immedi 

i have heard his argument but am still unconvinc 

he has had sever year experi and is thorough compet 


do not join independ claus by a comma 

if two or more claus grammat complet and not join by a 
conjunct are to form a singl compound sentenc the proper mark of 
punctuat is a semicolon 

stevenson romanc are entertain they are full of excit 
adventur 

it is near half past five we cannot reach town befor dark 

it is of cours equal correct to write the abov as two sentenc 
each replac the semicolon by period 

stevenson romanc are entertain they are full of excit 
adventur 

it is near half past five we cannot reach town befor dark 

if a conjunct is insert the proper mark is a comma rule 

stevenson romanc are entertain for they are full of excit 
adventur 

it is near half past five and we cannot reach town befor dark 

a comparison of the three form given abov will show clear the 
advantag of the first it is at least in the exampl given better 
than the second form becaus it suggest the close relationship between 
the two statement in a way that the second doe not attempt and better 
than the third becaus briefer and therefor more forcibl inde it 
may be said that this simpl method of indic relationship between 
statement is one of the most use devic of composit the 
relationship as abov is common one of caus or of consequ 

note that if the second claus is preced by an adverb such as 
accord besid then therefor or thus and not by a 
conjunct the semicolon is still requir 

two except to the rule may be admit if the claus are veri 
short and are alik in form a comma is usual permiss 

man propos god dispos 

the gate swung apart the bridg fell the portculli was drawn up 

note that in these exampl the relat is not one of caus or 
consequ also in the colloqui form of express 

i hard knew him he was so chang 

a comma not a semicolon is requir but this form of express is 
inappropri in write except in the dialogu of a stori or play or 
perhap in a familiar letter 


do not break sentenc in two 

in other word do not use period for comma 

i met them on a cunard liner sever year ago come home from 
liverpool to new york 

he was an interest talker a man who had travel all over the 
world and live in half a dozen countri 

in both these exampl the first period should be replac by a comma 
and the follow word begun with a small letter 

it is permiss to make an emphat word or express serv the 
purpos of a sentenc and to punctuat it accord 

again and again he call out no repli 

the writer must howev be certain that the emphasi is warrant and 
that he will not be suspect of a mere blunder in syntax or in 
punctuat 

rule and cover the most import principl in the 
punctuat of ordinari sentenc they should be so thorough master 
that their applic becom second natur 


a participi phrase at the begin of a sentenc must refer to the 
grammat subject 

walk slowli down the road he saw a woman accompani by two 
children 

the word walk refer to the subject of the sentenc not to the 
woman if the writer wish to make it refer to the woman he must 
recast the sentenc 

he saw a woman accompani by two children walk slowli down the 
road 

participi phrase preced by a conjunct or by a preposit noun 
in apposit adject and adject phrase come under the same 
rule if they begin the sentenc 

on arriv in chicago his friend met him at the station 

when he arriv or on his arriv in chicago his friend met him 
at the station 

a soldier of prove valor they entrust him with the defenc of the 
citi 

a soldier of prove valor he was entrust with the defenc of the 
citi 

young and inexperienc the task seem easi to me 

young and inexperienc i thought the task easi 

without a friend to counsel him the temptat prove irresist 

without a friend to counsel him he found the temptat 
irresist 

sentenc violat this rule are often ludicr

iii elementari principl of composit 


make the paragraph the unit of composit one paragraph to each 
topic 

if the subject on which you are write is of slight extent or if you 
intend to treat it veri briefli there may be no need of subdivid it 
into topic thus a brief descript a brief summari of a literari 
work a brief account of a singl incid a narrat mere outlin 
an action the set forth of a singl idea ani one of these is best 
written in a singl paragraph after the paragraph has been written 
examin it to see whether subdivis will not improv it 

ordinarili howev a subject requir subdivis into topic each of 
which should be made the subject of a paragraph the object of treat 
each topic in a paragraph by itself is of cours to aid the reader 
the begin of each paragraph is a signal to him that a new step in 
the develop of the subject has been reach 

the extent of subdivis will vari with the length of the composit 
for exampl a short notic of a book or poem might consist of a singl 
paragraph one slight longer might consist of two paragraph 

a account of the work 
b critic discuss 

a report on a poem written for a class in literatur might consist of 
seven paragraph 

a fact of composit and public 
b kind of poem metric form 
c subject 
d treatment of subject 
e for what chiefli remark 
f wherein characterist of the writer 
g relationship to other work 

the content of paragraph c and d would vari with the poem usual 
paragraph c would indic the actual or imagin circumst of the 
poem the situat if these call for explan and would then 
state the subject and outlin it develop if the poem is a 
narrat in the third person throughout paragraph c need contain no 
more than a concis summari of the action paragraph d would indic 
the lead idea and show how they are made promin or would 
indic what point in the narrat are chiefli emphas 

a novel might be discuss under the head 

a set 
b plot 
c charact 
d purpos 

an histor event might be discuss under the head 

a what led up to the event 
b account of the event 
c what the event led up to 

in treat either of these last two subject the writer would probabl 
find it necessari to subdivid one or more of the topic here given 

as a rule singl sentenc should not be written or print as 
paragraph an except may be made of sentenc of transit 
indic the relat between the part of an exposit or argument 
frequent except are also necessari in textbook guidebook and 
other work in which mani topic are treat briefli 

in dialogu each speech even if onli a singl word is a paragraph by 
itself that is a new paragraph begin with each chang of speaker the 
applic of this rule when dialogu and narrat are combin is 
best learn from exampl in wellprint work of fiction 


as a rule begin each paragraph with a topic sentenc end it in 
conform with the begin 

again the object is to aid the reader the practic here recommend 
enabl him to discov the purpos of each paragraph as he begin to 
read it and to retain this purpos in mind as he end it for this 
reason the most general use kind of paragraph particular in 
exposit and argument is that in which 

a the topic sentenc come at or near the begin 

b the succeed sentenc explain or establish or develop the 
statement made in the topic sentenc and 

c the final sentenc either emphas the thought of the topic 
sentenc or state some import consequ 

end with a digress or with an unimport detail is particular 
to be avoid 

if the paragraph form part of a larger composit it relat to 
what preced or it function as a part of the whole may need to be 
express this can sometim be done by a mere word or phrase again 
therefor for the same reason in the topic sentenc sometim 
howev it is expedi to preced the topic sentenc by one or more 
sentenc of introduct or transit if more than one such sentenc 
is requir it is general better to set apart the transit 
sentenc as a separ paragraph 

accord to the writer purpos he may as indic abov relat 
the bodi of the paragraph to the topic sentenc in one or more of 
sever differ way he may make the mean of the topic sentenc 
clearer by restat it in other form by defin it term by 
deni the contrari by give illustr or specif instanc he 
may establish it by proof or he may develop it by show it 
implic and consequ in a long paragraph he may carri out 
sever of these process 

now to be proper enjoy a walk tour should be gone upon 
alon if you go in a compani or even in pair it is no longer a 
walk tour in anyth but name it is someth els and more in 
the natur of a picnic a walk tour should be gone upon alon 
becaus freedom is of the essenc becaus you should be abl to stop 
and go on and follow this way or that as the freak take you and 
becaus you must have your own pace and neither trot alongsid a 
champion walker nor minc in time with a girl and you must be open 
to all impress and let your thought take colour from what you 
see you should be as a pipe for ani wind to play upon i cannot 
see the wit say hazlitt of walk and talk at the same time 
when i am in the countri i wish to veget like the countri 
which is the gist of all that can be said upon the matter there 
should be no cackl of voic at your elbow to jar on the medit 
silenc of the morn and so long as a man is reason he cannot 
surrend himself to that fine intox that come of much motion

it was chiefli in the eighteenth centuri that a veri differ

in narrat and descript the paragraph sometim begin with a 
concis comprehens statement serv to hold togeth the detail 
that follow 

the breez serv us admir 

the campaign open with a seri of revers 

the next ten or twelv page were fill with a curious set of 
entri 

but this devic if too often use would becom a manner more 
common the open sentenc simpli indic by it subject with what 
the paragraph is to be princip concern

the brief paragraph of anim narrat howev are often without 
even this semblanc of a topic sentenc the break between them serv 
the purpos of a rhetor paus throw into promin some detail 
of the action 


use the activ voic 

the activ voic is usual more direct and vigor than the passiv 

i shall alway rememb my first visit to boston 

this is much better than 

my first visit to boston will alway be rememb by me 

the latter sentenc is less direct less bold and less concis if the 
writer tri to make it more concis by omit by me 

my first visit to boston will alway be rememb 

it becom indefinit is it the writer or some person undisclos or 
the world at larg that will alway rememb this visit 

this rule doe not of cours mean that the writer should entir 
discard the passiv voic which is frequent conveni and sometim 
necessari 

the dramatist of the restor are littl esteem today 

modern reader have littl esteem for the dramatist of the 
restor 

the first would be the right form in a paragraph on the dramatist of 
the restor the second in a paragraph on the tast of modern 
reader the need of make a particular word the subject of the 
sentenc will often as in these exampl determin which voic is to 
be use 

as a rule avoid make one passiv depend direct upon anoth 

gold was not allow to be export 

it was forbidden to export gold the export of gold was prohibit 

he has been prove to have been seen enter the build 

it has been prove that he was seen to enter the build 

in both the exampl abov befor correct the word proper relat 
to the second passiv is made the subject of the first 

a common fault is to use as the subject of a passiv construct a noun 
which express the entir action leav to the verb no function 
beyond that of complet the sentenc 

a survey of this region was made in 

this region was survey in 

mobil of the armi was rapid effect 

the armi was rapid mobil 

confirm of these report cannot be obtain 

these report cannot be confirm 

compar the sentenc the export of gold was prohibit in which the 
predic was prohibit express someth not impli in export 

the habitu use of the activ voic make for forcibl write this is 
true not onli in narrat princip concern with action but in 
write of ani kind mani a tame sentenc of descript or exposit 
can be made live and emphat by substitut a verb in the activ 
voic for some such perfunctori express as there is or could be 
heard

it was not long befor he was veri sorri that he had said what he had 

he soon repent his word 


put statement in posit form

the tame of the shrew is rather weak in spot shakespear doe

the last exampl befor correct is indefinit as well as negat 
the correct version consequ is simpli a guess at the writer 
intent 

all three exampl show the weak inher in the word not 
conscious or unconsci the reader is dissatisfi with be told 
onli what is not he wish to be told what is henc as a rule it is 
better to express even a negat in posit form 

not honest

there is a general agreement among those who have enjoy the

all who have tri surfrid agre that it is most exhilar 

if those who have studi the art of write are in accord on ani one 
point it is on this that the surest method of arous and hold the 
attent of the reader is by be specif definit and concret 
critic have point out how much of the effect of the greatest 
writer homer dant shakespear result from their constant 
definit and concret brown to cite a more modern author 
afford mani strike exampl take for instanc the line from my 
last duchess

inconsist pride hypocrisi ignor of itself love of art of 
luxuri of good latin to quot ruskin comment on the poem is made 
manifest in specif detail and in concret term 

prose in particular narrat and descript prose is made vivid by 
the same mean if the experi of jim hawkin and of david balfour 
of kim of nostromo have seem for the moment real to countless 
reader if in read carlyl we have almost the sens of be 
physic present at the take of the bastill it is becaus of the 
definit of the detail and the concret of the term use it 
is not that everi detail is given that would be imposs as well as 
to no purpos but that all the signific detail are given and not 
vagu but with such definit that the reader in imagin can 
project himself into the scene 

in exposit and in argument the writer must likewis never lose his 
hold upon the concret and even when he is deal with general 
principl he must give particular instanc of their applic 

this superior of specif express is clear due to the effort

in the lefthand column ask and accept are present 
participl in the righthand column they are verbal noun gerund 
the construct shown in the lefthand column is occasion found 
and has it defend yet it is easi to see that the second sentenc

accept in this exampl at least the construct is plain 
illog 

as the author of the king english point out there are sentenc 
appar but not realli of this type in which the possess is not 
call for

same except for a slight loss of vivid if he had written 

i cannot imagin lincoln refus his assent to this measur 

by use the possess the writer will alway be on the safe side 

in the exampl abov the subject of the action is a singl unmodifi 
term immedi preced the verbal noun and the construct is as 
good as ani that could be use but in ani sentenc in which it is a 
mere clumsi substitut for someth simpler or in which the use of the 
possess is awkward or imposs should of cours be recast

necessari

anteced is a distribut express such as each each one 
everybodi everi one mani a man which though impli more than 
one person requir the pronoun to be in the singular similar to this 
but with even less justif is the use of the plural pronoun with 
the anteced anybodi ani one somebodi some one the 
intent be either to avoid the awkward he or she or to avoid 
commit oneself to either some bash speaker even say a friend 
of mine told me that they etc
