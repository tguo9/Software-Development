Below are some hints that may help with this homework assignment:

- You need to have the third-party [Apache OpenNLP](http://opennlp.apache.org/) library setup as a user library in Eclipse for this assignment. See the [Adding User Libraries to Eclipse](https://usf-cs212-fall2018.github.io/guides/adding-user-libraries-in-eclipse.html) guide for details.

- The methods for cleaning and parsing text are already provided in the `TextParser` class. You can use this class for your homework and project.

See [Lambda Expressions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html) and [Lesson: Aggregate Operations](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/index.html) in the Java Tutorials for examples.

- You should use try-with-resources and buffered readers and writers. See the [Files and Exceptions](https://github.com/usf-cs212-fall2018/lectures/tree/master/Files%20and%20Exceptions) examples from lecture.
