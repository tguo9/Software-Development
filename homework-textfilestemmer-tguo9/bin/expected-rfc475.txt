ftp and network mail system 

this paper describ my understand of the result of the network 
mail system meet sriarc on februari and the 
implic for ftp file transfer protocol there was general 
agreement at the meet that network mail function should be within 
ftp 

ftp current provid two command for handl mail the mail 
command allow a user to send mail via the telnet connect the 
server collect the mail and determin it end by search for the 
charact sequenc crlfcrlf the mlfl mail file command allow 
a user to send mail via the data connect requir a userftp to 
handl the command but transfer is more effici as server need not 
search for a special charact sequenc these command are be 
use to provid network mail facil local mail and sndmsg 
program have been modifi at mani site to includ network mail 
eg userhost at bbntenex and mail host user at mitdmcg 

the network mail system should provid a facil wherebi user can 
conveni send messag to other network user who have 
mailbox at one or more host it is not requir that the 
messag or mail be deliv in realtim the network mail system 
is not an interact interconsol communic facil but it 
may be possibl for some site to deliv urgent mail to user in 
realtim eg print mail at user consol if user is current 
loggedin the mail system also doe not provid a general inter 
process communic facil though it may be possibl to deliv 
messag to program which have mailbox address interprocess and 
interent communic facil are veri desir but are 
beyond the scope of the network mail system 

the concept of mailbox and mailbox address are central to this 
discuss of network mail system a mailbox is a place where the 
mail is store befor a user pick it up it may be a file in the 
user directori or it may be a bin for hardcopi the mailbox 
address is the address requir by the sender in order to send the 
mail to it destin mailbox for user who have an onlin 
network mailbox the mailbox address contain the host address and 
the user mailbox identif at that host the mailbox 
identif is that which is requir by an ftpserver in order 
that it may put the mail in the desir mailbox the term mailbox 
address will be use to refer to the onlin network mailbox address

network mail system function 

the network mail system should provid the follow six function 

creat this refer to the manner in which the user creat or 
compos his messag the ftp server do not explicit provid 
ani messag edit capabl server edit convent may 
be applic in the case of mail command edit convent 
such as those for charact delet and line cancel vari wide 
over the network the user is most familiar with his local host 
convent and these should be use for network mail edit 
the user also has access to local edit system which can be 
use for compos messag file the messag file may then be 
transmit via the mail or mlfl command mlfl be prefer 
the present ftp approach of assum the creation of messag to 
be sender respons seem adequ tip user if they 
desir edit facil should use intermedi host for 
creat and send messag 

locat how sender determin receiv address ftp assum 
that the sender know the receiv correct address there is no 
publish or onlin list of mailbox address there is 
howev a list of network particip maintain onlin and 
publish by the network inform center nic at sriarc the 
network user have been assign a uniqu nic ident and host 
site by the nic it was therefor specifi in ftp that ftp 
server maintain a tabl that map nic ident to mailbox 
identif the nic will maintain onlin and publish the 
local mailbox address inform for network particip it 
would be possibl for user to look up a publish list or querri 
the nic onlin to locat destin address the nic will 
also provid an onlin facil similar to ftp that can be use 
by program for retriev the address inform this latter 
approach of the nic maintain address has sever 
advantag the user can obtain a number of address for a 
group and use these to transmit mail the ftp server need not 
maintain nic ident tabl and the nic can provid a good facil 
for locat address from last name nic ident or even 
sketchi inform it may still be desir that ftp server 
accept nic ident last name and other standard form as mailbox 
identifi 

send how messag is sent to the destin mailbox the 
messag may be sent direct to the destin mailbox via 
telnet or data connect or via an intermedi host such as 
the nic ftp doe not explicit provid for mail forward by 
intermedi host but ftp server may be abl to recogn 
address as not be local and forward mail in the event mail 



bhushan page 

rfc ftp and network mail system march 


is to be forward a desir facil is to have the 
intermedi site return an acknowledg by request upon 
deliveri of mail or if deliveri fail within a specifi time 
the current ftp specif recommend that ftpserver accept 
multipl address but do not requir this 

store where mail is store befor read and if inform is 
avail for later refer or retriev the ftp doe not 
requir that sender store mail or keep duplic copi it is 
the receiv respons to store the inform for 
read refer or retriev the receiv need not store the 
mail as a data file but can direct print it out on a user 
consol or line printer ftp doe not specifi the procedur for 
storag handl by intermedi site if intermedi site is 
use for forward the mail until it is deliv to it final 
destin if the mail is undeliver then the intermedi 
site should return the undeliv inform to the sender a 
similar situat aris when send of mail is defer by the 
send site destin host may be down the send site 
then act as an intermedi forward insofar as the user is 
concern 

record should the mail be catalogu and record for later 
refer and retriev ftp current doe not provid an 
explicit mechan for the receiv to record mail if an 
intermedi site the nic is use for mail distribut then a 
function of such a site could be to record mail if so request 
nic is ideal for record mail but other site may also wish to 
record the mail if the mail is record then it is not 
necessari to send the entir content of the mail instead onli a 
citat for the document can be sent and the receiv can 
retriev the mail onli if he want to this is particular 
use for larg document such as nwgrfc which are distribut 
to a group the citat may contain author titl retriev 
pathnam and perhap an abstract 

read how the mail is final present to and read by the 
user ftp current assum that mail read is entir the 
receiv site function howev there are way in which the 
sender can aid the receiv in provid improv mail read 
facil for exampl the receiv system if it know a 
messag to be urgent can deliv it immedi at a user consol 
long messag may be put in separ file with notif in 
user regular mail altern mail could be a citat that 
the read program can retriev upon user request select 
handl of differ class of mail is import for an improv 
network mail system

model for mail system use 

the user of a mail system can use intermedi site for locat 
address record andor distribut mail and for creat and 
read mail we therefor have the follow model for mail system 
use 

the user connect direct to the destin ftp server and send 
mail use the mail command local edit function are limit 
to charact delet and line cancel assum user is in lineat 
atim mode and server convent may also appli the user onli 
need a usertelnet program at his site but need to know the 
destin address this model is special applic to tip 
and other minihost user who do not have a userftp or usermail 
program 

the user compos the mail use a local editor or mail system 
and then request his userftp or mail program to send the mail 
direct to the destin via the ftp mail or mlfl command 
the user need to know the destin address the mail can be 
defer by the send program if the destin host is down 
tip user can use this model by use the facil of a home 
base host 

the user use an intermedi site such as nic other site may 
provid forward servic too for mail distribut the user 
need not know the destin address but can use nic ident for 
individu and group of individu the mail can be record 
on request and it send can be defer the destin host 
may be down or it may be more econom to defer mail the 
messag to be mail may be creat at the local site use local 
edit facil or it may be creat direct at the 
intermedi site 

the user may send a citat of the mail instead of the complet 
mail item the citat refer to an exist document which can 
be retriev onlin such as the nic number of a nic journal 
communic 

mail to tip user 

the tip doe not current provid an ftp server or mailbox 
facil while it is possibl to send mail to tip termin such 
as line printer it seem undesir to do so becaus of the 
possibl of lose mail the lack of privaci and the fact that 
user may be sever or sever hundr mile away from the locat 
of the tip the tip user normal have a homebas comput where 
they do their comput work most of the time the tip user problem 



bhushan page 

rfc ftp and network mail system march 


is best solv by requir that tip user rent mailbox at their 
homebas host such a host can provid good mail read and 
querri facil a tip user can request his home host to send 
him notif of mail on a tip termin if rdml command nwgrfc 
is accept in ftp tip user could use such a command more 
import if the user has a number of mailbox on differ host 
the rdml or rdmf command can be use to read his mail at all the 
site where he has mailbox 

access control in mail system 

it has been suggest that ftp specif should requir that mail 
function for receiv mail should be free ie ftp server 
should not requir the user to login send the user pass and acct 
command in the absenc of the access control command the ftp 
server should charg the cost of receiv mail to an overhead or 
brows account it should be note that this free mail function 
use default user account may not allow non mailrel command 
without reiniti this requir will improv communic 
among the network user 

some system such as multic have mechan for access control in 
the receipt of mail that is a user can specifi who is elig to 
send him mail normal user give then access ie ani 
one can send mail the access control command would be requir to 
gain privileg access the user command doe not seem the best way 
to identifi the sender of mail consid user log in as guest 
iccc network mitdmcg and networkus a separ from command 
seem desir such a command can be use to identifi the sender 
as well as to send acknowledg and repli the receiv site 
can tag the mail as from akb at mitdmcg log in as guest the 
receiv can then send repli to the mailbox address akb at host 
sndmsg akbdmcg or mail dmcg akb 

network inform center function 

the nic is a veri special facil for handl mail it provid 
facil for record and distribut mail to individu and 
group of individu and for locat user address the nic 
will also undertak to provid distribut of unrecord mail 
current the nic requir that user log into the nic and use nls to 
creat and distribut mail use nls for creat mail has been a 
frustrat experi for mani who are use to differ edit 
system recent there has been a problem that nic is overload at 
most time of the day and even if one can get a network termin 
and log in the interact is quit slow as nic or nls is 
design for characteratatim interact with remot echo the 




bhushan page 

rfc ftp and network mail system march 


use is ineffici use nic is particular unbear when the 
user fall behind in his echo by as much as an entir line 

an altern to direct use of nic is to use the nic via ftp and 
program at the user site the user can creat journal document 
use his own local edit system and then transfer it to nic via 
ftp the user may have to specifi such inform as author titl 
where the acknowledg should be sent and journal number if the 
item is to be record it should also be possibl for user to send 
sequenti file to nic and have them restructuredinto nls form 
without have to do an input sequenti a suggest is to nls 
the file if it name is suffix with a nls altern it should 
be possibl for user to retriev journal document and other 
sequenti file without have to do a previous output sequenti 

the nic current deliv mail via hardcopi andor onlin onlin 
current mean that user must log into nic to see if he has a 
messag and read it by print branch the messag are not seen by 
the destin user for sever day and mani user get their hard 
copi befor they have had a chanc to examin their onlin nic mail 
if the nic were to deliv mail via ftp to network user then the 
mail turnaround time will be great speed and the user will not 
have to log into the nic larg document need not be mail to the 
user in their entireti but onli a citat need be sent the nic 
willhav to collect the inform on the mailbox address of 
network particip for deliv mail especi sinc it appear 
that mani ftp server are not respect nic ident it is 
recogn that a user may have onli one the most use of these 
address 

the nic identif subsystem current access via nls onli 
contain inform on user such as affili us mail address 
telephon number etc and group member etc the onlin 
mailbox address inform can be ad here the nic will 
undertak to provid a facil wherebi the identif subsystem 
can be querri by program allow mail program to retriev 
the address automat this facil will be separ from 
ftp 

ftp modif 

the ftp current doe not provid explicit facil for record 
mail communic sender address send program readabl 
citat specifi author and titl for document request 
acknowledg and indic messag type urgent ordinari and 
long to overcom these defici we can take ani of the 
follow approach 




bhushan page 

rfc ftp and network mail system march 


kludg the desir featur in the pathnam syntax of the mail and 
mlfl command justifi the kludg on the ground that most of 
the function are to be use onli by the nic 

add new command for the desir function and alter the mail and 
mlfl command somewhat to recogn the exist of the new 
command 

defin a new mail command which incorpor the miss function 
in the process defin new command for the desir function 
the mail and mlfl command can be use in their present form but 
may be gradual phase out 

the first approach seem undesir to me as mani of the miss 
function can be use by other site as well in addit it will be 
easier to write program to deal with command rather than a complex 
syntax the second and the third approach are not veri differ 
from each other the third approach seem prefer as it will 
allow exist mail program to function in their present form 
use the third approach consid the follow new ftp command 

mlto mail to the argument is one or more mailbox identifi 
separ by comma it is suggest that if there is no 
argument the mail should be sent to some respons user or 
print on a printer this command start the sequenc of 
option ftp mail relat command describ below the sequenc 
end with the text file or cita citat command 

from the argument is the address of the sender or sender it is 
in a standard form that can be interpret by program as well as 
human user the inform is to be use for identifi the 
sender for send repli and for send acknowledg if 
the receiv is an intermedi forward site 

mtyp mail type this identifi the type of mail as u urgent 
o ordinari and l long the receiv system can take the 
appropri action from this knowledg the default assumpt 
is ordinari mail 

reco record the mail the argument if present is the identifi 
inform for record such as nic journal number if no 
argument is present the server will assign the record 
inform and send an appropri repli realtim or defer 

auth author identifi the author of the document in a form 
accept to the server nic ident may be requir by nic 





bhushan page 

rfc ftp and network mail system march 


titl titl identifi the titl of the document the argument 
is an ascii string end with the sequenc crlfcrlf 

ackn acknowledg relev for intermedi forward site 
ask the server to send acknowledg on deliveri or if deliveri 
fail within a specifi time 

text no argument start the transfer of mail over telnet 
connect in an ident manner as mail 

file no argument start transfer of mail over the data 
connect in an ident manner as mlfl 

cita citat argument is the pathnam of retriev file 

we also need to defin new repli code for handl mail some site 
have express the need for repli such as send onli x byte of 
mail other repli could specif request addit command 
such as userpassacct for privileg mail fromackn for mail 
forward and authtitl for record mail anoth suggest that 
may be given consider is allow typebyt other than a for 
file command mail larg file between like machin such as 
pdps is more effici in i the rdml and rdmf command 
propos by bressler and thoma nwgrfc also merit 
consider as they would aid the handl of mail for user who 
have mailbox at differ host 


this rfc was put into machin readabl form for entri
